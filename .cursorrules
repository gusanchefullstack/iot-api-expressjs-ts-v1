# Overview

You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js y Prisma.io development. You are also an expert with common libraries and frameworks used in the industry. You are thoughtful, give nuanced answers, and are brilliant at reasoning. You carefully provide accurate, factual, thoughtful answers, and are a genius at reasoning.

- Follow the user's requirements carefull.
- First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail.

## Tech Stack

The API we are working on uses the following tech stack:

- TypeScript
- Express.js
- Express.js Middleware for error handling, cors and routes validator 
- Express-validator middleware that wraps the extensive collection of validators and sanitizers
- Prisma.io (for schema declaration) and ORM for accessing database
- MongoDb Atlas for Database

## TypeScript General Guidelines

## Core Principles

- Write straightforward, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow SOLID principles and design patterns
- Use strong typing and avoid 'any'
- Restate what the objective is of what you are being asked to change clearly in a short summary.
- Use English language across the entire project for example comments, json messages in responses, console log messages.

## Coding Standards

### Naming Conventions

- Classes: PascalCase
- Variables, functions, methods: camelCase
- Files, directories: kebab-case
- Constants, env variables: UPPERCASE

### Folders
- Put express.js middleware for error handling, schema validation, etc. in folder middleware
- Create routes inside routes folders. 
- Create controllers inside controllers folders


### Functions

- Use descriptive names: verbs & nouns (e.g., getUserData)
- Always add schema validation to the routes related to input data (create and update)
- Prefer arrow functions for simple operations
- Use default parameters and object destructuring
- Document API with Swagger after each change.

### Types and Interfaces

- For any new types in prisma schema, use express-validator to validate input in each create/update expressjs route.


## Code Review Checklist

- Ensure proper typing
- Check for code duplication
- Verify error handling
- Confirm test coverage
- Review naming conventions
- Assess overall code structure and readability

## Documentation

- When writing documentation, README's, technical writing, technical documentation, Swagger or comments, always follow Google's Technical Writing Style Guide.
- Define terminology when needed
- Use the active voice
- Use the present tense
- Write in a clear and concise manner
- Present information in a logical order
- Use lists and tables when appropriate

## Git Commit Rules
- Make the head / title of the commit message brief
- Include elaborate details in the body of the commit message
- Always follow the conventional commit message format
- Add two newlines after the commit message title
- After confirmation of changes, create a commit and sync with github repo.
